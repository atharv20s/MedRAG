# 🧠 RAG Knowledge Retrieval System

A **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pipeline that enables intelligent document-based information retrieval and context-aware answer synthesis — combining semantic vector search with large language model reasoning.

---

## 🚀 Overview

This project implements a **modular, production-style RAG pipeline** designed to answer domain-specific queries by retrieving the most relevant document chunks and generating answers grounded in factual context.

Unlike chatbots, this project emphasizes **retrieval precision**, **vector similarity search**, and **knowledge-grounded reasoning**, representing a research-grade architecture for enterprise and academic search systems.
